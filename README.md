<h1>Bash scripts</h1>
This repository consists of 6 bash script files for:<br>
-makeing pictures with a Raspberry pi zero, 3b+<br>
-recording videos in Full HD - zero, 3b+<br>
-streaming to Youtube with and without sound - Raspberry pi 3b+<br>
Here is a sample <a href=https://youtube.com/live/PTZmwGcl-UY>video</a> from that streaming. (Made with a official raspberry pi camera module and a usb sound card)<br>
with a raspberrian strech and a copy of a ffmpeg installed. Additional setup <a href=https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/tutorials/2016/streaming-live-to-youtube-and-facebook-using-raspberry-pi-camera>link</a>.<br>
In order to run them (./file.sh) you have to make them executable by typing: chmod +x file.sh<br>
2 addisonal files are for takeing Black and White pictures and videos with a raspberry pi 4b+ and a HQ Camera module. Files don't display preview when executed.<br>

In the picture we got a PiHut HQ Camera Mount aviable at ThePiHut web page, a HQ Camera Module, a Raspberry Pi 4b+ and a Touch Screen. The pinhole is a RealitySoSubtle laser drilled 0.1mm pinhole.

Here is the optional setup (without the HQ Camera module) for recording with sound but in my expierience the video got bit choppy sometimes and the sound would disappear or go out of sync.<br>
Probably I need some help with it.<br>
Here is a <a href=https://youtu.be/ZF2mWPosFeI>video</a> recorded with that setup.
